The repo is organized as follow:

`/scripts/` contains `.R` files that simulates, downloads and cleans the dataset.

/outputs/paper/ contains the `.qmd` file that generates the report, references, and pdf version of the paper.

/inputs/ contains the `.csv` files that stores the retrieved data from `opendatatoronto` and cleaned data.

## Usage of LLM
